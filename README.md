### Background Story:
I always liked the camera body of the Lomo LC-A and I didn't enjoy how expensive the Lomography Minitar lens was. I wanted to replicate the experience of shooting with the LC-A with sliding lens cover, and lever acuated aperture and focus. I picked up a lens assembly from a broken LC-A and started working on translating the LC-A's sliding lens cover and once I figured that out I applied the same assembly to the aperture as space was limited. I could have easily made an iris but there was not enough room to allow for multiple mounts.

If you have a broken LC-A you can put the lens to good use now with this rehousing. It's a pretty simple print with minimal post processing.
