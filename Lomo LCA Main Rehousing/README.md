### Features:
- Iconic Sliding Lens Cover
- Lever actuated Aperture and Focus
- Standard LOMO or classic ЛОМО face plate

### What you'll need:
- 15x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws (PETG) or self-tappin screws (ABS or PETG)
- 1x M1.6 tap

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit
- Micro files
- PTFE synthetic grease

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientationFile.3mf' files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore for screw holes that aren't tapped.

Test fit before assembling. Will need to file parts to allow free movement. You may need to drill out the original mounting holes on the Minitar lens assembly for the m1.6 screws to fit.

Lightly grease the shutter and aperture tracks and the blades.

To assemble correctly, please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.
